## My Build of Suckless's Simple Terminal with a few tweaks made for my preference.
### Patches added:
  I added/applied three patches: alpha, clipboard, scrollback, and dracula. Alpha to enable translucent windows, clipboard to enable copy and paste, scrollback to enable scrollback with [Shift + PageUP or PageDown], and dracula for a color scheme.
### Other Tweaks made:
  I changed the font size because default was way too small.
